Warp Trials

----> REQUIRES JAVA VERSION 21 <----

--- About ----

A collaborative research project designed with the intention to gauge, compare, and record different cursor warping mechanisms based on entirely Java and its libraries (JavaFX, Robot, etc). The program is organized through a model-view-controller (MVC) architecture for organization and scalability, aiming for a low-coupling and high-cohesion framework. 
Using the Fittsâ€™s Index of Difficulty in conjunction with time-based trials, the program can collect and organize specific data, such as trial numbers, click errors, elapsed time, etc., to visually present in graph form.
This project is a joint effort between Aaron Mee, Jessie Patterson, Siddharth Padakanti, and Andy Giang.
