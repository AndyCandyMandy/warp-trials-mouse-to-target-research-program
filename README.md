Warp Trials
----> REQUIRES JAVA VERSION 21 <----

--- About ----

A collaborative research project designed with the intention to gauge, compare, and record different cursor warping mechanisms based on entirely Java and its libraries. The program is organized through a model-view-controller (MVC) architecture for organization and 
scalability, aiming for a low-coupling and high-cohesion framework. Using the Fittsâ€™s Index of Difficulty in conjunction with time-based trials, the program can collect and organize specific data, such as trial numbers, click errors, elapsed time, etc., to visually 
present in graph form.
